## Features

- **Email Breach Scanner**  
  Query the XposedOrNot breach database to identify breaches associated with an email address. Outputs a formatted table of breach names and statuses.

- **Breach Analytics Engine**  
  Deep-scan an email to retrieve a risk score (0‚Äì100), a risk label (Low/Medium/High), industry exposure breakdown, and password strength profile (plaintext leaks, easy-to-crack hashes, strong hashes, unknown).

- **Password Exposure Scanner**  
  Compute a SHA3-512 hash prefix of any password and anonymously check if it appears in known breaches. Reports occurrence count and password composition statistics.

- **Domain Breach Lister**  
  Fetch and display a list of breached domains and exposed record counts (shows top 25 by default).

- **Browse All Breaches**  
  Interactively list all recorded breaches (optionally filtered by domain), including breach ID, domain name, and breach date.

- **Automated Dependency Management**  
  Verifies Python ‚â• 3.6 and pip availability. Automatically installs or upgrades required packages: `requests`, `tabulate`, and `colorama`. Provides colorized, animated CLI output.

## Use Cases

1. **Security Research**  
   Rapidly enumerate breach data for target email addresses, domains, or passwords.

2. **Incident Response**  
   Assess the scope and risk level of credential compromise following a suspected breach.

3. **Compliance Auditing**  
   Verify that organizational emails and domains are free from known breaches.

4. **Password Hygiene Checks**  
   Proactively test corporate or personal passwords against breach databases to enforce strong credential policies.
